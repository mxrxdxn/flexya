# Flexya
Flexya is a super simple CSS grid system based on flex and heavily inspired by Bootstrap's grid system.

It features a configurable amount of columns, a configurable grid-based implementation and easy-to-modify breakpoints.

## Installation
`npm i flexya`

## Usage
To include Flexya, just import the `flexya.scss` file in your SCSS.
```scss
@import "variables";
@import "~flexya/src/flexya.scss";
```

## Helpers
Flexya ships with some helpful mixins to help keep your code maintainable.
### breakpoint-up($breakpoint)
A mixin media query that applies for the given breakpoint and above.
```scss
@include breakpoint-up("desktop") {
    .row {
        color: red;
    }
}
```
Translates into:
```css
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
    .row {
        color: red;
    }
}
```
### breakpoint-down($breakpoint)
A mixin media query that applies for the given breakpoint and below.
```scss
@include breakpoint-down("desktop") {
    .row {
        color: red;
    }
}
```
Translates into:
```css
@media (max-width: 1199.99px) {
    .row {
        color: red;
    }
}
```
### breakpoint-only($breakpoint)
A mixin media query that applies only for the given breakpoint.
```scss
@include breakpoint-only("desktop") {
    .row {
        color: red;
    }
}
```
Translates into:
```css
@media (min-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 1399.99px) {
    .row {
        color: red;
    }
}
```
### breakpoint-between($lowerBreakpoint, $upperBreakpoint)
A mixin media query that applies only between the two given breakpoints.
```scss
@include breakpoint-between("tablet", "desktop") {
    .row {
        color: red;
    }
}
```
Translates into:
```css
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1199.99px) {
    .row {
        color: red;
    }
}
```

## Customization
### Changing the breakpoints
You can alter any of the breakpoints used by Flexya as well as the class names generated by adding the following to your SCSS file before importing Flexya:
```scss
// Breakpoints
$breakpoints: (
    "mobile":           ("min-width": 0,      "prefix": false),
    "large-mobile":     ("min-width": 576px,  "prefix": "lm"),
    "tablet":           ("min-width": 768px,  "prefix": "t"),
    "landscape-tablet": ("min-width": 992px,  "prefix": "lt"),
    "desktop":          ("min-width": 1200px, "prefix": "d"),
    "large-desktop":    ("min-width": 1400px, "prefix": "ld")
);

// Base column class name
$columnClass: "col";

// Base offset class name
$offsetClass: "offset";
```
You are welcome to rename any of the breakpoints, as well as the prefixes as these will correctly update the next time you build your CSS. You can also add or remove breakpoints as you see fit!
### Changing the column count
Need more columns, or want to remove some to reduce file size? Simply include the following above where you import Flexya.
```scss
// How many columns to put into .row and .grid
$columnCount: 12;
```
### Enable CSS Grid
Want to use the CSS grid? Enable it with the following:
```scss
// Enable grid class generation
$enableGrid: true;
```
Note that CSS grid is disabled by default.
### Enable utilities
We also bundle in some utilities (disabled by default) to make some basic flex layouts easier to achieve. You can enable then like so:
```scss
// Enable utilities
$enableUtilities: true;
```
